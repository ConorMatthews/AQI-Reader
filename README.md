# AQI Reader

This was written for my A Level CompSci course however it was cancelled due to Covid 19.
Please don't use this if you are taking a CompSci A level as it may be checked aginst this.
This code got given an A grade which kinda shows how much of the coursework grade is based around your write up.
I'm also vey supprised this works and may not it the future.
